Failure is delay, not defeat.  It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing'];

Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong ', 'There is no love without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without love.', 'Anger makes you smaller, while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were', 'In finding love, I think it is important to be patient.

Success is measured by your discipline and inner peace', 'You have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become uninterested in money, compliments, or publicity', 'The greatest legacy one can pass on to ones children and grandchildren is not money or other material things accumulated in ones life, but rather a legacy of character and faith'];
